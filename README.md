# 🌻 Plants vs Zombies

## Project Overview

The zombies are coming, and they're hungry for brains! In this tower defense game, you must defend your home by strategically planting various types of plants, each with unique abilities. From basic pea shooters to explosive jalapeños, build your garden defense and survive waves of increasingly dangerous zombies.

Battle through different environments from your backyard lawn to the rooftop, facing off against zombies wearing traffic cones, buckets, and even a massive Gargantuar boss. Can you protect your house from the zombie invasion?
